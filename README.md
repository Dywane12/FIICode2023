Welcome to our medical application: MedEase !!!
 
This project was meant to improve the work of each patient, but also make consultation scheduling for doctors
a lot easier, containing also some **EXTRA** user-friendly features such as the option for patients to give a rating from 1 to 5 
to their doctor for a better functioning of the community, the option to specify the lifestyle of the patient, if he is a smoker, 
drinker, has any allergies that might be worth mentioning before taking a certain type of medication and also a section for 
the doctor to recommend his patient a certain medication.
Our application is also operating with a database that is set to generate a bunch of doctors, patients, allergies and so on in order for 
us to check teh functionalities at any given time.
Besides that, the app meets every requirement from the given pdf, has an interesting and minimalistic design,it is mostly responsive 
and the color theme white+purple is used on almost each page.
Another aspect to be mentioned is that the sms functionality only works (for now) for numbers that are verified by the app "Twilio", 
as you need to pay for a subscription in order for it to work on every number possible.(hopefully we happen to have access to the one present in the video).
